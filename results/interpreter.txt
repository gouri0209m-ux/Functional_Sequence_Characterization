The protein under analysis was originally annotated as a hypothetical protein, 
indicating that its biological function had not yet been determined.

Following sequence quality assessment and homology-based comparison, 
the protein showed significant similarity to (S)-ureidoglycine aminohydrolase, 
an enzyme known to participate in amino acid metabolism.

This finding suggests that the protein is likely involved in metabolic pathways 
related to the degradation or utilization of amino acids. 
Enzymes of this type play an essential role in maintaining cellular metabolism 
and overall energy balance within the organism.

Overall, this study highlights how computational approaches can help 
predict the function of previously uncharacterized proteins, 
providing valuable insights into their potential biological roles.
